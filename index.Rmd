## Overview of the research

In this assignment I am analysing Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) customer satisfaction survey openly available [here](https://hsl.louhin.com/asty/help). This dataset has been wrangled to meet the needs of my analysis, and the wrangling script is available [here](). I will use the logistic regression method to see whether or not specific variables such as gender, availability of seats and punctuality of transport to explain the target variable overall grade given to HSL. The aim is to identify factors related to high / low satisfaction with HSL.

**Research question**: Which of the following variables are related to high satisfaction HSL: punctuality, space, meeting travel needs, gender, age, access to a car, value for money and frequency of use?

**My hypothesis**: All of the variables except for gender and age are related to satisfaction with HSL:

+ Punctuality: the more punctual the transportation, the more satisfied customers are
+ Space: the more available seats there are, the more satisfied customers are
+ Meeting travel needs: the more HSL transportation meets their needs, the more satisfied customers are
+ Access to car: customers without access to car are happier with HSL (since they don't have an alternative)
+ Value for money: customers who see HSL as bringing good value for money are happier with HSL
+ Frequency of use: the more frequent the use of HSL transportation, the more satisfied customers are (since they haven't changed to another alternative - some users may on purpose avoid HSL leading to less frequent use)

HSL dataset from my local folder.

The first task in my data wrangling was to choose the variables to analyse, as the dataset has 340 378 observations and 127 variables! Moreover, when exploring the variables, I noticed that some of them have a lot of missing values. For example the variable 'K1A8L' (the ferry's timetables suit my travel needs) has over 331 000 missing answers, probably explained by the fact that not many people use a ferry on day-to-day travel. However, the variable 'K3B' (overall grade for HSL-region public transport) is only missing some 10 000 responses out of ovr 340 000.

Here are the variables chosen for this study:

+ K3B (Yleisarvosana HSL-alueen joukkoliikenteelle)
levels:
+ K1A4 (Bussit / vaunut / lautat liikenn??iv??t t??sm??llisesti aikataulun mukaan)
+ K2A1 (Istumapaikan saa t??h??n aikaan p??iv??st?? t??ll?? linjalla)
+ K2A2 (Linja / metro / paikallisjuna palvelee matkustustarpeitani)
+ T6 (Sukupuoli)
+ T71 (Ik??ryhm??)
+ T8 (Olisiko Teill?? ollut mahdollisuus k??ytt???? henkil??autoa t??ll?? matkalla?)
+ T17 (Joukkoliikenne antaa vastinetta rahalle)
+ T1 (Kuinka usein keskim????rin matkustatte t??ll?? linjalla?)
